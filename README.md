# Guides, Utils, Scripts and Templates for PowerShell

This repository contains some useful stuff for working with PowerShell. Besides a [Style Guide](/Guides/PowerShell_Quick_Style_Guide.md) and [Templates](/Templates), you can find also several useful modules.

## Style Guide

The Style Guide is intended to be a short overview of [The PowerShell Best Practices and Style Guide](https://poshcode.gitbooks.io/powershell-practice-and-style/). You can find it [here](/Guides/PowerShell_Quick_Style_Guide.md).

## Templates

My templates have emerged over the past years during which I have worked with PowerShell. You can find them [here](/Templates).

## Modules

Besides an Utils module, most of the modules are clients for working with APIs.

You can find the following modules in this repository:
- CyberArkClient
- Terraform (just a script)
- Utils
- VMware
    - NsxClient
    - VCloudClient
    - VSphereClient
